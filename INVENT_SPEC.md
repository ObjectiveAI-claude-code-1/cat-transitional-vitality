Rank cat pictures by transitional vitality — the degree to which the cat is captured in a state of becoming rather than a settled state of being. Evaluate whether each image shows a cat visibly between two conditions, shaped by the forces of competing states. Look for physical transitions: a body mid-stretch with the face contorted in effortful pleasure, a cat shifting from sitting to standing with weight distributed unevenly, a head in the act of turning so that the motion itself is visible in asymmetry or slight blur, a body mid-leap between surfaces. Also look for emotional and attentional transitions: the moment a resting cat's eyes open and awareness floods back into its face, a playful cat freezing into sudden uncertainty, an aloof cat softening into affection, the instant curiosity ignites or attention snaps toward a stimulus. Rank images higher when they vibrate with implied before-and-after — when you can sense what the cat was just doing and what it is about to do, and the image feels like a single frame pulled from a continuous flow of living experience. Rank images lower when the cat appears fixed in a single stable condition with no visible evidence of change, process, or transition — a cat fully at rest, fully alert, or fully posed with no sense that it is moving between states.
