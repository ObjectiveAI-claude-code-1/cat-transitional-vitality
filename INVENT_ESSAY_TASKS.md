1. Evaluate the kinetic imprint of the cat in the image by examining its body for visible evidence of physical motion in progress. Look for postural asymmetry, uneven weight distribution, limbs caught between positions, spines arched beyond their resting curvature, paws extended mid-reach, and any geometry of the body that only makes sense as a transitional frame between two stable poses. A cat whose body communicates passage — one paw lifted, shoulder blades shifted unequally, tail mid-swing — scores high, while a cat whose body communicates permanence — sitting symmetrically, paws tucked, posture settled — scores low. The distinction is not simply between action and stillness; a cat in steady, uniform motion scores lower than a cat whose body is visibly between two different physical states.

2. Evaluate the emotional flux visible in the cat's face, eyes, ears, and overall bearing by looking for evidence that the cat's internal state is actively shifting rather than settled. Look for eyes that are open but not yet focused, ears rotating toward a stimulus, pupils mid-dilation, facial muscles transitioning between slack softness and gathered alertness, or any expression that carries two competing emotional states simultaneously — such as playfulness freezing into uncertainty, or aloofness softening into affection. A cat displaying a single stable expression — purely calm, purely alert, purely annoyed — scores low, while a cat whose face is legibly between two states, carrying traces of what it was just feeling and hints of what it is about to feel, scores high.

3. Evaluate the narrative tension of the image as a whole by assessing whether the composition implies a clear before and after, creating the sensation that this single frame has been pulled from a continuous unfolding sequence. Consider the relationship between the cat and its surroundings: a cat on the edge of a surface with a paw extended into open air, a cat in a doorway between rooms, or a cat whose attention is fixed on something outside the frame all suggest a moment caught between what just happened and what is about to happen. An image where you can sense the seconds surrounding the capture — what the cat was just doing and what it will do next — scores high, while an image that feels temporally flat, where the cat could have been in that exact position for seconds or hours with no implied trajectory, scores low.
